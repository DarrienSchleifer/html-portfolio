        <p>Hello, my name is Darrien Schleifer!</p>
        <p>
            I am 22 years old and go to the University of Central Florida. I am a Digital Media major and have a passion for creating. It took me a while to find what I want to pursue in life as a career, and I have changed my major multiple times, but this time I know for a fact I found what I want to do. I started doing graphic design at 15 years old because I wanted to make art for my social media gaming pages. The more I learned about design I fell in love with it. Recently, I have found interest in computer programming. I took multiple courses in my free time exploring what programming and coding had to offer for me. Now it is not only something I am studying, but something I genuinely love to do and learn about. My goal is to pursue a career that combines my design talents with my newfound interest in computer programming.
